"""Turn an unstructured dump into a reviewable profile proposal.

The input is whatever the user has: a paragraph they dictated, several resumes
tailored for different roles, a LinkedIn URL, a GitHub URL, loose links. The
output is a *proposal* -- never a saved profile.

That distinction is the whole design. An LLM reading a resume will happily
produce a confident job title that is a paraphrase, a date that is a guess, or a
metric it rounded. Those become claims made under the user's name on a real
application. So the model proposes, the user accepts field by field against the
source text, and only then does anything reach `profile.yaml`.

Two hard constraints, enforced by the schema rather than by asking nicely:

  * There is no screening field in the tool schema. The model cannot propose an
    answer to work authorization, criminal history, sponsorship or consent even
    if the dump discusses them, because there is nowhere to put it. Those come
    only from the user choosing in the editor.

  * Numbers must be copied, not recomputed. A bullet's metric is the one piece
    of a resume a reader can check, and a "improved" figure is fabrication.

SYSTEM = """You organize a job applicant's raw material into a structured profile.

Everything you output becomes a claim the candidate makes to real employers under
their own name, so accuracy beats completeness every time.

RULES
- Report only what the sources state. If a field is not supported, omit it. An
  omitted field is correct; an invented one is a false statement on a job
  application.
- Copy numbers exactly. "Cut p99 from 840ms to 95ms" stays those numbers. Never
  round, scale, recompute, or add a metric that is not in the source.
- Never invent an employer, title, date, school, degree, or technology.
- Never write a placeholder like "<UNKNOWN>", "N/A" or "TBD" into a field. If
  you do not have the value, leave the field out entirely -- it gets flagged
  for the candidate. A placeholder gets printed on a resume.
- Dates: use YYYY-MM-DD, first of the month when only a month is given. If a
  date is genuinely absent, omit it rather than estimating, and say so in notes.
- Several resumes tailored for different roles describe the SAME career. Merge
  them per role, keeping the most specific and most quantified phrasing. Do not
  emit one experience entry per resume.
- Where two sources conflict on a fact, take the more specific one and record
  the conflict in notes. Never silently pick.
- Dictated input is speech: it will have filler, restarts and asides. Clean it
  into plain prose. Cleaning means removing filler and fixing grammar -- it does
  NOT mean adding detail, sharpening a claim, or inferring a number.
- Never assert work authorization, visa sponsorship, citizenship, criminal
  history, background-check or drug-test consent, veteran or disability status,
  age, or education completion. There is deliberately nowhere in your output to
  put those; the candidate sets them themselves.
- Write bullets and prose in the candidate's own voice: plain, specific, no
  marketing language, no "passionate about", no "leveraged".

You already know what is in their profile. Propose ADDITIONS and CORRECTIONS
from the new material; do not re-propose a field that is already correct."""
