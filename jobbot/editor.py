"""Profile editor: the form that fills `config/profile.yaml`.

Everything jobbot says in the candidate's name comes out of that file, and until
now the only way to write it was to hand-edit YAML. This is the same record as a
form, with room for the things no fixed schema anticipates.

Two rules the UI enforces, because they are the point of the project:

  * A screening answer is only ever what the user chose. Every one starts
    "not set" and stays that way until they pick. Nothing is pre-selected, no
    default is "yes", and "not set" is a real, saveable state that halts the
    relevant application rather than guessing.

  * Saving never silently destroys the previous answer set. The old file is
    copied to `config/profile.<timestamp>.yaml` before the new one is written,
    and the new one is validated through the pydantic model first -- an invalid
    submission leaves the file on disk untouched.
