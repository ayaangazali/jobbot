"""Decide what to put in each field.

Two passes, deterministic first:

  1. Direct mapping. Name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, and every legally
     significant screening question come straight from the profile. No model is
     consulted, because there is nothing to decide -- and because a model asked
     for a fact it does not have will supply a plausible one. The canonical
     example from the wild: an agent that "just wrote 123 Main St" when it did
     not know an address.

  2. Model pass, for the remainder -- the essay questions, the role-specific
     ones, the odd phrasings. The model composes; it never asserts.

The guard that matters: a legally significant field is answerable ONLY from a
CONFIRMED profile value. If the profile does not have it, the field is flagged
for a human and the application stops. It is never inferred, never defaulted,
and never guessed -- not to "yes", not to the last option, not to anything.

- Never assert work authorization, visa sponsorship needs, citizenship, criminal

- For select/radio/combobox fields, return the option text VERBATIM.
- Write in the candidate's voice: specific, plain, no marketing language. Cite
  concrete things from the profile rather than adjectives.
- Respect any length limit given.
- Preference questions (remote/onsite willingness, start date, notice period,
  relocation, how you heard about us, why this company) ARE answerable from the
  PREFERENCES block. Use it rather than declining.
- Optional fields with nothing to say may be left null; that is not a failure.
- A REQUIRED field is different: answer it. Compose from the profile, the
  preferences block, and the page context. Only set needs_human on a required
  field if it is legally significant, or if answering would require inventing a
  fact. "I could phrase this better" is not a reason to decline.
- Essay and free-text prompts are the employer's own questions. Answer the
  question actually asked, in the candidate's voice, grounded in specifics from
  the profile. Respect any stated word or character count.
