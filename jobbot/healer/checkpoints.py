"""The three vision checkpoints, and the healing loop between them.

  1. PARSE   -- before touching anything. Read every question off the rendered
                page, cross-checked against the DOM. Catches fields the DOM
                misses (canvas widgets, iframed sections) and fields the DOM
                reports but a human cannot see.

  2. VERIFY  -- after filling, before submitting. Re-read the page as rendered
                and compare every visible value against the profile. Loop:
                fix, re-screenshot, re-verify, until clean or the round budget
                runs out. This is where a wrong answer gets caught while it is
                still retractable.

  3. OUTCOME -- exactly one call after submitting. Did it actually go through,
                and what should change next time?

Checkpoint 3 exists because silent success is the dominant failure mode in this
category of software. Prior art is full of it: a widely-used applier logs
"applied successfully" for jobs that were never submitted, with users reporting
their success file holding far more entries than their account shows
applications. A click is not confirmation. Only affirmative on-page evidence is.
