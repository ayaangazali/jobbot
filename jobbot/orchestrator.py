"""End-to-end pipeline for one application, and the loop over many.

Stage order is the single most consequential design decision here, and it is
driven by cost. The expensive, irreversible work -- generating a GitHub project,
tailoring and rendering a resume -- happens only AFTER we have confirmed the
form is reachable and winnable.

The failure mode that ordering avoids is documented: one published run generated
2,019 tailored resume files and 1,083 cover letters to produce 112 submissions,
because it tailored before discovering the form needed an account it could not
create. Almost all of that work was thrown away.

So the pipeline is cheap-to-expensive:

    discover -> dedup -> ghost filter -> fit filter        (free, no browser)
    open tab -> detect ATS -> account wall                 (cheap)
    checkpoint 1: parse the form                           (one vision call)
    knockout pre-scan                                      (one cheap call)
    -- only now --
    build GitHub project, tailor resume, render PDF        (expensive)
    fill -> checkpoint 2 + heal loop -> submit             (careful)
    checkpoint 3: did it actually go through?              (one vision call)
