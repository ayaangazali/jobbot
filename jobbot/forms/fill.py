"""Write answers into a live form.

Per-control strategy, each choice driven by a documented failure mode:

  react-select (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever)
      Rebuilds its DOM on every keystroke. Any cached element handle goes stale
      mid-word. Type character by character and re-query the listbox each time.

  Autocomplete / typeahead
      `fill()` sets .value and fires one input event, which never opens the
      suggestion list. Type sequentially so the widget's own key handlers run.

  Lever checkboxes and radios
      Programmatic clicks on them are reported to trigger hCaptcha. Prefer the
      associated label element, which is what a human actually clicks.

  Workable
      Aggressively re-renders; re-query immediately before every interaction.

  File upload
      `set_input_files` against the hidden <input type=file> bypasses the OS
      dialog entirely. Never click the pretty "Attach" button first.

Everything here is idempotent and verifies its own write. A fill that silently
does nothing is the single most expensive bug in this system: it surfaces as a
validation error at submit, after the resume and the project already exist.
