A model asked for a dropdown value will happily write "Bachelor's degree" when
the only option is "Bachelors Degree (BA/BS)". Submitting free text into a
<select> either throws or silently selects nothing, and a silently-empty
required field fails validation at submit -- after the expensive work is done.

Four passes, cheapest first, mirroring the approach that works well in prior
art: exact -> containment -> stem -> token overlap. Anything below threshold
fails closed and is escalated rather than guessed.
