"""The candidate profile: the single source of truth for every answer.

Design rule, and the most important one in this codebase:

    The model may compose prose. It may never invent a fact.

Screening questions carry legal and contractual weight. Work authorization,
sponsorship, criminal history, background-check and drug-test consent, veteran
and disability status, age, and education claims are all statements the
candidate makes under their own name -- often under an explicit attestation of
truthfulness. A wrong answer is not a bug, it is a false statement on a job
application.

So every field here is typed by provenance:

    CONFIRMED -- the user stated it. Usable.
    INFERRED  -- derived by the system. Usable ONLY if not legally significant.
    MISSING   -- unknown. Never guessed; the application halts and asks.

Prior art motivates this directly. One widely-used open-source applier shipped
hardcoded felony and background-check answers for every user until a reviewer
caught it; a popular commercial extension is documented defaulting unknown
yes/no screeners to "yes" and submitting anyway. Both are the same bug: a
system answering a legally significant question it was never told the answer to.
